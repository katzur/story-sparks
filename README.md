# UX
## Strategy
### The Issue
When browsing in the Internet to find more about the candle industry, I noticed that the market is covered in mass-production, low quality candles with generic scents. Big brands have the monopol and sell their products in every
online store with home decor. But the consumers are looking for variety, affordable prices and quality in their candles, as well as someting that would stand out. The trend of supporting local, small companies and artists is growing stronger and more creative companies should show their craft mastery on the market to give big brands solid competition.

### The Vision
Story Sparks Co. was created as a response to the current retail needs described above. The vision behind creating this store was focused on delivering a User an option to purchase something extraordinary, not currently seen on the
candle market. No matter if the User is looking to purchase a candle to treat themselves, or a unique gift, that will bring a smile on loved one's face - Story Sparks delivers. Those are inteligent, funny candles that reflect and 
comment our current lifestyle. The scents offered are unique and present a strong opposition to what big brands produce commonly. Uniqueness is Story Spark's strenght and might be an inspiration for other small brands that are looking
for their way to start operating on the online market.

Store is easy and clear to navigate, based on the principle of "mobile first approach", which gives the freedom of using it on any type of device due to its full responsiveness. The aim was to provide all the main, necessary features expected for an e-commerce store.

### Target Audience
Consumers that appreciate high-quality, handmade candles with unique scents and labels. Story Sparks Co. ensures to use only natural ingredients and supports zero-waste movement, as the jars and tins can be re-used for other purposes. 
No plastic, no worries. Story Sparks Co. labels contain witty comments on our 21st century lifestyle, hence the target audience will be mainly young adults (aka Millenialls), who can identify themselves with words written on the candles. Other Users in different age groups will find Story Sparks Co. attractive as well, since it's a great place to purchase candles as a gift for the loved ones, who might be in a young adults age group. By implementing modern design, intuitive navigation and simple images Story Sparks Co. is aspiring to be a store suitable for all the age groups.
